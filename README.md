# flora
a flower that blooms the closer you get to it and closes up when you're further away! 

i wanted to make it because i make a lot of pipe cleaner/paper flowers so i was wondering if there was a way to make my flowers a hardware project. after some deliberation i figured this was a pretty fun project since i've never really worked with arduino before, i get to engineer the flower to be large and it's fun craft-wise also.

## inspo
i actually had this idea myself but upon googling i found this wonderful inspiration and absolutely had to mention it - [the tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@ingawoods.waight/video/7220271294841998638?lang=en). she made it in a *weekend* and i'm trying to model how my project looks after hers! huge props.
