# journaling my journeying

## 18-19 May (not very specifically documented sorry. i forgot)

okay! my idea for this whole project is basically a big ol pretty flower that opens up when you stand near it (so, arduino with distance sensor). i spent some time coming up with this idea because i really love making crafty flowers. i regularly make pipe cleaner/chenille and crepe paper flowers for my friends and birthdays and stuff!

if you don't believe me, here's my reference from valentine's day last year:

so i figured i'd motorise something like that. i found some stuff online like on pinterest but those flowers are like secretly protected by their makers so i'm going to have to improvise probably. i'm thinking of using an arduino, distance sensor and some servos.

this project is fairly mechanical, which means it's out of my pay grade for now. but we're here to learn! and of course my first step was to make a paper prototype-ish out of free foolscap i got handed outside my school.

so i cut out some rough outlines, attached it to a circle and tied some string. then i tried playing around with it to figure out how the servos could get it to open and i got a rough idea.

i think for the actual thing instead of directly attaching the petals i'd want to use some bendy but half rigid plastic so it can snap back into place. because when i bend out the paper it crumples and doesn't go back to normal. and i think the string can be tucked into the circle too (maybe a bigger circle of foam board or smt) so there's more structure

alas, when i left for school and returned my paper flower was nowhere to be seen ): i guess someone assumed it was trash. rip

i guess over the next few days (or, i mean, after wednesday when i have an exam) i'd want to draw up a proper list of everything i need, wiring diagrams and maybe.. (ew) go on fusion.

update: i found a tiktok video of someone who actually did the same thing the internet is crazy. she put a mirror in the centre of the flower. i think that would be really cute.

time spent: 4 hours

## 21 May
just had an exam! yay! 2 things to do today - wiring and my bom

we did some wiring practice today - aka i learnt how to wire arduino stuff and got super intimidated. but it's actually not that deep surprisingly. i also found the models for the parts i plan to use which is good because bom!

after googling a bunch and looking through a lot of other peoples' arduino wiring designs i got this abomination (actually, this wasn't the worst. this was halfway through me detangling it)

![oh](https://github.com/mynameisashllee/flora/blob/main/journalassets/21may/what.png?raw=true)

what the heck. i'm so sorry you had to see that.

anyway, we did it!

not actually using a 9v battery, 6v instead (4 aa batteries) which hopefully works..! i panicked a lot about this and went to my friend who's on the school robo team for advice but she said it was okay

things i learnt:
- connect everything to ground and 5v on the breadboard
- dont connect power to arduino

and did the bom too (sort of, lol)

time spent: 3 hours but spread out
